<h2><a id="overview"/>Overview</h2>
<p>Flotilla is a naval warfare game between two players. After both players have placed their ships on the board, the
    game begins.
    Players will take turns firing ordinance at grid positions. Different ordinance types have different effects (see
    the ordinance section below).
    Each shot will be marked as either a hit (red) or a miss
    (white). At the conclusion of each turn, the ships will all move according to their speed (see the ships section
    below). The first player to sink their opponent's entire fleet wins.</p>
<h3><a id="howtoplay"/>How to Play</h3>
<h4><a id="joining"/>Joining a Game</h4>
<p>The first two participants to join a game room are the players and
    all subsequent participants that join the same room will be set up as observers. Players can see their own ships on
    the top grid and
    keep track of their shots on the bottom grid. Observers will see both players ships (player 1 on the top and player
    2 on the bottom). All participants can use the chat box to interact with one another. In addition to participant
    messages, game messages will also be sent to the chat box.</p>
<a href="#top" class="backlink">(back to top)</a>
<h4><a id="ships"/>Ships</h4>
<p>There are 5 types of ships in the game. Each ship has its own speed and number of hits required to sink as outlined
    in the table below. The speed indicates how many grid squares the ship will advance after each turn. When a ship
    reaches the edge of the grid,
    it will reverse direction 180 degrees -- for instance, if it was travelling up, it will turn so it will travel down.
    Turning around counts as its movement for that turn.</p>

<h4><a id="placement"/>Ship Placement</h4>
<p>When the game first begins, it will be in 'placement' mode. When in this mode, the two players can drag their ships
    to the desired initial positions on their ship grid (the top-most grid). A ship must be fully on the grid (no part
    of it may extend beyond the grid surface) for it to be a legal placement.
    When a ship is on the grid, double-click it to rotate it.</p>
<p>Ships may overlap. Note if a shot hits a grid cell that contains multiple ships <i>all</i> of the ships will be hit.
</p>
<p>Once all ships are on the grid, the "Ready" button will appear. After the player is satisfied with how their ships
    are arranged, click in the ready button.
    Once the button has been clicked, the ships will not be able to be moved.</p>
<a href="#top" class="backlink">(back to top)</a>
<h4><a id="playmode"/>Play Mode</h4>
<p>Once both players have clicked "Ready" the game transitions to "Play" mode. In this mode, players take turns firing
    at their opponent. To fire, a user selects the desired ordinance (see below) and then clicks the grid square to
    target. The grid squares affected by the shot will be colored red if it was a hit and white if it was a miss. Each
    shot square will also contain a number. This is the number of turns since that shot was fired. Since ships move, a
    cell that was a miss could become a hit at a
    later time (or vice versa) so a player may have to fire at the same space more than once. If the cell that was fired
    upon was a miss but it was a hit on some prior turn, the cell will be colored pink.</p>
<p>As a player's ships are hit, a red square will be shown on top of the ship where it was hit. Once all positions of a
    ship have been hit, it is sunk. Sunk ships remain on the board but no longer move. Hitting a ship in a position that
    was already hit (regardless of whether it has been sunk) will always be scored as a miss.</p>

<h5><a id="ordinance"/>Ordinance</h5>
<p>There are 3 types of ordinance available to players. Players have an unlimited number of shells but finite number of
    other types. See the table below for details.</p>

        <td>Unlimited</td>

        <td>3</td>
        <td>Hits a 3x3 square of cells centered at the cell at which it was fired.</td>

        <td>Reveals a 5x5 section of the game board, centered at the cell at which it was fired. The reveled section of
            the grid will be shaded with a light color. Cells that contain an enemy ship will be shaded darker. The
            shading fades as turns progress.
